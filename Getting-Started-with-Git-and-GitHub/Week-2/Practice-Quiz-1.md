## Practice Quiz 1 GitHub Workflows with Branches and Git Commands

## Question 1
**What is stored on the master or main branch?**
- [ ] Files which contain documentation only
- [x] The deployable version of the project code
- [ ] The original, unchanged version of the code
- [ ] All the project files, including files from forks

The master branch is definitive by default and stores the deployable version of your code.

## Question 2
**Which Git command transfers changes from your local repository to the remote repository?**
- [ ] git-remote
- [x] git-push
- [ ] git-pull
- [ ] git-fetch

The `git-push` command transfers changes from your local repository to the remote repository.

## Question 3
**When would you fork a project?**
- [ ] To add a branch to an existing tree in the project
- [ ] To give a new user permissions to the project
- [x] To use an existing repository as the base for a new project
- [ ] To create a backup of the master branch of the project

Forking allows you to modify or extend a repository without affecting the original repository. Frequently, developers use forking to take an existing repository and make it the starting point for your new project.

## Question 4
**Which GitHub developer command prepares an email submission in a form appropriate for a Linux kernel-style public workflow?**
- [ ] git-request-pull
- [ ] git-request-email
- [x] git-format-patch
- [ ] git-send-email

You use `git-format-patch` to prepare email submissions if you adopt Linux kernel-style public forum workflow.

## Question 5
**Which Git command can a repository administrator use to allow anonymous downloads from the repository?**
- [ ] git-remote
- [ ] git-shell
- [ ] git-am
- [x] git-daemon

A repository administrator can use the `git-daemon` command to allow anonymous downloads from the repository.
