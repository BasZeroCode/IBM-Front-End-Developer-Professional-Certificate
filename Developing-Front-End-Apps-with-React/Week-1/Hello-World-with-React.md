## Creating my first React page and my first React application. 
As the first step to learning anything new in the coding world, you will render a ‘Hello World’ page.


Create a simple React page
Create, run and render a React application
Set properties for a react component

In the terminal, paste and run the following command to go to the home/project directory.

**cd /home/project**

Run the following command to create a react application named myfirstapp. It is mandated that the React application name cannot contain any uppercase letter.

**npx create-react-app myfirstapp**

Once the installation is over, the application is created inside a folder with the name specified by you for the application. Change to that folder by running the following command.

**cd myfirstapp**

create-react-app creates the boilerplate code which is required for you to run a basic React app. To check the react app that has been created, run the following command.

**npm start**

This will start the react development server on port 3000.

Click on the Launch Application button below or the SkillsNetwork Toolbox logo and from the options choose OTHER and click Launch Application. 
Enter the port number 3000 and click on the arrow mark to launch the application.
