## Graded Quiz REST Architecture and Watson API Week 5

## Question 1

**What is Representational State Transfer (REST)?**

- [ ] A server-side application
- [ ] A web resource
- [x] An architectural style
- [ ] An API

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used when creating web services. It is not a server-side application or a specific API but a design philosophy.

## Question 2

**Fill in the blank: REST uses a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to _____.**

- [x] Describe the network location of the resource to retrieve or update
- [ ] Post data to the server
- [ ] Define the structure of a web page
- [ ] Use lightweight data models

REST uses URIs to identify resources and perform actions on those resources, such as retrieving or updating data.

## Question 3

**What do you use to call a REST service?**

- [ ] HTML resources
- [ ] Server entry points
- [ ] HTTP method nouns
- [x] HTTP method verbs

 To call a REST service, you use HTTP method verbs (e.g., GET, POST, PUT) to perform actions on resources.

## Question 4

**Which of the following are characteristics of REST and REST services?**

- [ ] REST provides a simple approach for building services for client/server interactions
- [ ] REST services follow standard protocols
- [ ] REST services tend to use lightweight data models
- [x] All of the above

All the given options are characteristics of REST and REST service

## Question 5

**What does a REST service do when you apply it to a server-side application?**

- [ ] Describes its location on the network server application resource
- [ ] Defines the structure of a web page
- [x] Makes available an application as a web resource
- [ ] Codes the server side in a language like Java or Python

A REST service makes an application available as a web resource through its API.

## Question 6

**Which of the following elements could the REST service write in a response?**

- [ ] Content-length
- [ ] Response body
- [ ] Date
- [x] All of the above

A REST service response may include elements such as Content-length, Response body, and Date.

## Question 7

**On which two structures is JSON built?**

- [ ] List of values and markup language
- [ ] Name-value pairs and HTTP
- [x] Name-value pairs and list of values
- [ ] Array-value pairs and key lists

JSON is built on the structures of name-value pairs and lists of values.

## Question 8

**Which of these is NOT a characteristic of JSON?**

- [x] Markup language
- [ ] Nesting of objects
- [ ] Easy for applications to parse and generate
- [ ] Lightweight data interchange format

JSON is not a markup language; it is a lightweight data interchange format.

## Question 9

**What do Watson services allow you to build?**
1 point
- [ ] Unstructured data
- [ ] IBM Cloud API Docs
- [ ] IDE
- [x] Cognitive apps

Watson services allow you to build cognitive applications that leverage natural language processing and machine learning technologies.

## Question 10

**What do you need to do to use Postman to interact with the Watson Natural Language Understanding (NLU) service?**

- [ ] Get an IAM token from the userâ€™s NLU service API
- [ ] Have the NLU service already created on your IBM account
- [ ] Send the URL of the data in the body of the request
- [x] All of the above

To use Postman with the Watson NLU service, you need to get an IAM token, have the NLU service created on your IBM account, and send the URL of the data in the body of the request.
