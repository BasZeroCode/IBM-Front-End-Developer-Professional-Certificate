# Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

## What is Software Engineering?

- Software Engineering is the application of scientific principles to the design and creation of software.
- It uses a systematic approach to collect and analyze business requirements to design, build, and test software applications to satisfy those requirements.

### Software Engineers vs Software Developers

| Software Engineers               | Software Developers                                                    |    
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| Also Developers                  | Narrower in scope than SE                                               |     
| Broad, big picture knowledge base | Creative approaches                                                      |     
| Systematic development process    | Write code to implement specific functionality and solve specific problems |     
| Focus on broad structure          | Focus on solving an immediate problem                                    |     

## Software Development Cycle (SDLC)

### 1. Planning

- Interviews, direction for the project, risk identification, quality assurance, allocation of human and financial resources.
- Emphasizing the role of stakeholders in ongoing communication throughout the project is important.
- **Project Manager** - Responsible for overseeing the entire project, facilitating communication, and ensuring smooth project execution.
- **Scrum Master** - Ensures the success of the team by facilitating agile processes and removing impediments.
- **Business Analyst** - Analyzes business needs, identifies project requirements, and communicates them to the development team.
- **Stakeholders** - Includes customers, end-users, decision-makers, and key personnel who play a role in project decisions. They may also participate in beta testing and acceptance testing before launch.

### 2. Gathering Requirements & Analysis

- Identify any risk and document high-level goals.

### 3. Design

- System design/architecture, blueprint.
- The architecture is reviewed by stakeholders and the team.
- During this phase, prototypes can be designed.
- **UX Designer** - Defines the user experience, ensuring the software is user-friendly and aligns with user expectations.
- **System/Software/Solution Architect** - Designs and communicates the overall architecture, both high-level and detailed, to the development team.

### 4. Development/Coding

- The project planners use the design document to determine and assign coding tasks.
- Writing code, longest phase in cycle.
- **Software Developer/Engineer, Database Developer** - Implements the architecture, writes code, and ensures it meets the specified requirements.

### 5. Testing

- Test for bugs or defects are found, fix it.
- **Quality Assurance (QA) Tester** - Writes and executes test cases, identifies and reports defects, and ensures the software meets quality standards.

### 6. Deployment

- It can happen in stages, first, it is released to user acceptance testing (UAT) platform, and once the customer signs off on the functionality, it is released to production.
- Software is ready to use, download now.
- **Site Reliability Engineer** - Tracks and communicates incidents, automates systems, procedures, and processes, and troubleshooting.
- **DevOps Engineer** - Manages the deployment pipeline, automates processes, and ensures smooth deployment of the software.

### 7. Maintenance

- Additional bugs may need to be fixed, or minor adjustments.
- Mentioning the importance of versioning and release notes for tracking changes during deployment.
- **Application Support Engineer** - Provides ongoing support for the application, addressing issues, and ensuring its continuous functionality.
- **Technical Support Specialist** - Assists users with technical issues, gathers feedback, and communicates user needs to the development team.

## Prototype

- A prototype is a small replica of the end product used to get stakeholder feedback; it is used to test basic design ideas.

## Versions of the Software

- It is referred to as a *release*.
  
### 1. Alpha

- The first functioning version of the system released to a select group of stakeholders.
- May contain errors.
- May not contain the full feature set but does contain most of the desired functionality.

### 2. Beta

- Released to all stakeholders.
- Trying out the software under real conditions, test the functionality, and identify any outstanding bugs or errors.
- It should meet all functional requirements.

### 3. General Availability

- After the beta release changes are agreed upon, made and tested, and a stable version is released.
- The audience for GA release is for all users.

## System Documentation

- Should be provided to both non-technical end-users and technical users.
- Technical users may be engineers, developers, or architects.
- The documentation consists of **README files, inline comments, architecture and design documents, verification information, and maintenance guides**.

## User Documentation

- Is provided to the non-technical end-user to assist them in the use of the product.
- It consists of **user guides, instructional videos, manuals, online and inline help**.

## Requirement Specification

### 1. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

- Captures functionalities the software should perform.
- Establishes benchmarks.
- Who has access to the SRS?
- How it should be used?
- The

### **2. User Requirements Specification (URS)**

- Describe business need and end-user expectations.
- Who is the user?
- What is the function that needs to be performed?
- Why does the user want this functionality?
- This is usually confirmed during acceptance testing and often combined into SRS.

### **3. System Requirements Specification (SysRS)**

- Outlines requirements of the system.
- Contains system capabilities, interfaces and user characteristics.
- Policy, Regulation, Personnel, Performance, Security requirements and System acceptance criteria.
