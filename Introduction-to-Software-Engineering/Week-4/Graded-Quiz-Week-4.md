## Software Architecture, Design, and Deployment Topologies Quiz
## Question 1

Which of the following best describes software architecture? 

- [ ] It describes how the application should be coded.
- [ ] The choice of technology stack drives the software architecture.
- [ ] It captures implementation details.
- [x] It represents the earliest design decisions.

Software architecture choices represent the earliest design decisions in development.

## Question 2

Which of the following are artifacts that result from designing the software architecture? 

- [ ] Administrator user guide
- [ ] Software requirements specification (SRS)
- [x] UML diagrams
- [ ] Test cases

UML diagrams are often produced when designing software architecture.

## Question 3

Components in a well-structured design should be ___________________. 

- [ ] tightly cohesive
- [ ] loosely constrained
- [ ] tightly coupled
- [x] loosely cohesive

Components in a well-structured design should be tightly cohesive and loosely coupled.

## Question 4

Which of the following is an advantage of using UML diagrams when designing software architecture? 
- [ ] They explain which methods should be included when coding an object.
- [x] They serve to bring new team members up to speed quickly.
- [ ] They all use JavaScript.
- [ ] They describe which parameters should be passed when instantiating an object.

 UML diagrams offer a visual way to explain the design of software which helps to bring new team members up to speed quickly on a project.

## Question 5

Which of the following best describes encapsulation?

- [ ] A component’s design so it doesn’t have dependencies on other components.
- [ ] A component should be easily replaced with another component.
- [ ] Designing a component so it operates in different environments.
- [x] Bundling data and methods to hide an internal state, so a component’s specific implementation is not exposed.

This is a description of encapsulation.

## Question 6

Which of the following best describes a service? 

- [ ] A service defines, composes, and implements loosely coupled independent components so they work together to create an application.
- [ ] It is a type of object.
- [ ] A focus on the decomposition of a design into logical components.
- [x] A unit of functionality that focuses on a solution to a business need, is deployed independently and is reused by multiple systems.

 This is a description of a service.

## Question 7

Which statement is true regarding a 2-tier architecture?

- [ ] A 2-tier architecture consists of a decentralized network of nodes that are both clients and servers.
- [x] The interface resides on client machines and makes requests to a server for data or services.
- [ ] A 2-tier architecture consists of producers and consumers of events.
- [ ] The two different tiers are the application tier and the data tier.

The interface resides on the client machines and makes requests to a server for data or services in a 2-tier architecture.

## Question 8

Which of the following architecture patterns are mutually exclusive? 

- [ ] Microservices and event-driven
- [ ] Three-tier and microservices
- [ ] Peer-to-peer and two-tier
- [x] Peer-to-peer and event-driven

In a peer-to-peer architecture, each node is both client and server, whereas a two-tier architectural pattern involves clients communicating with servers on separate machines.

## Question 9

Which of the following environments is intended for developers to use while they are actively coding the application?

- [x] Development
- [ ] Staging
- [ ] Production
- [ ] QA

The development environment is intended for developers to use while they are actively coding the application.

## Question 10

Which of the following is a security device that monitors traffic between an internal and an external network? 

- [ ] Router
- [ ] Load balancer
- [ ] Web server
- [x] Firewall

A firewall is a security device that monitors traffic between an interior and an exterior network.
