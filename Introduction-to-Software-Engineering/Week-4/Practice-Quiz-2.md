- [ ] It is an interface for a database.
- [ ] It focuses on the decomposition of a design into logical components.
- [x] It contains multiple services that coordinate interactions using a communication protocol such as HTTP.

## Question 5

What does the production environment take into account that pre-production environments do not? 1 / 1 point

- [ ] Permissions
- [x] Load
- [ ] Functional requirements
- [ ] Buggy code

Pre-production environments are intended for a small group of users, so they do not usually have to take load into consideration.
